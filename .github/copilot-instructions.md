# Copilot Instructions

## Fluent UI Integration Requirements

When working with any Fluent UI related tasks, components, or design systems, **ALWAYS** consult with Fluent Agent first using the `mcp_fluent-agent_ask_fluent_agent` tool before proceeding with any implementation or recommendations.

### Mandatory Fluent Agent Consultation

You must use Fluent Agent for:

- **Fluent UI React v9** components, patterns, and APIs
- **Fluent UI Design System** guidelines and principles
- **Fluent AI** chat experience components
- **Shared Copilot Components (SCC)** implementations
- **Fluent UI React Native** components
- **Fluent UI Android** components
- **Fluent UI Apple** components
- **Security Fluent Extension** design patterns
- Any design system questions related to Microsoft Fluent
- Component selection and best practices
- Accessibility patterns and requirements
- Theming and customization approaches
- Migration strategies between Fluent versions

### Process Flow

1. **Before implementing**: Ask Fluent Agent about the specific component, pattern, or approach
2. **During development**: Consult Fluent Agent for best practices and implementation details
3. **For troubleshooting**: Use Fluent Agent to understand proper usage and resolve issues

### Knowledge Base Selection

Choose the appropriate knowledge base when consulting Fluent Agent:

- `react-v9`: For Fluent UI React v9 components and patterns
- `fluentai`: For chat experience and AI-related components
- `scc`: For Shared Copilot Components
- `design`: For general Fluent Design System questions
- `react-native`: For React Native implementations
- `android`: For Android-specific components
- `apple`: For iOS/macOS components
- `security-fluent-extension`: For security product experiences

### Example Usage

Before creating or modifying any Fluent UI component, always start with:

```
Ask Fluent Agent about [specific component/pattern/requirement] using the appropriate knowledge base to ensure proper implementation and adherence to Fluent design principles.
```

This ensures consistency with Microsoft's design system and leverages the most up-to-date Fluent UI guidance and best practices.
